Configuration Management:  
Configuration management is a process for tracking changes in a project and ensuring that all components work 
together seamlessly. We used Git to manage versions of our code, making teamwork more efficient. With Git, 
we could track changes and roll back if something went wrong.

Git Workflow:  
Our Git workflow included the following steps:

- Cloning the project using `git clone`.
- Creating new branches for different features with `git checkout -b`.
- Making changes and adding them with `git add` and `git commit`.
- Pushing changes to the remote server with `git push`.
- Creating pull requests for review and merging.
- Pulling the latest changes from the main branch with `git pull`.

Experiences with Configuration Management:  
Positive: Git helped us organize our changes and avoid conflicts while working in parallel.  
Challenges: We encountered issues with merge conflicts, especially when multiple members worked on the same files.  
Solutions: We resolved conflicts manually by reviewing and selecting the appropriate versions. 
Improved communication could have helped us avoid these conflicts.

What We Did During Submission Assignment 1: Collaboration and Configuration Management:  
We set up a Git repository for the project and chose our development environments. We collaborated effectively, 
using Git for version control. Our progress was documented in engineering diaries, noting what we learned, 
which Git commands we used, and the challenges we faced. We made regular commits and worked in different branches 
to maintain organization and facilitate collaboration throughout the project.

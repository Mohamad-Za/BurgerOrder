Assignment 1: Collaboration and Configuration Management
Introduktion
Today, we divided the work among ourselves and carefully reviewed the assignments to ensure everyone was on the same page. 
We spent time reading the instructions and discussing them to clarify any uncertainties. Everyone received a clear task,
and we distributed the workload fairly and efficiently. The goal was to ensure that we all understood what needed to be 
done and could proceed with a clear picture of our respective responsibilities.

Cloning via GitHub turned out to be the simplest way for us to share the project smoothly. We tried using the 
"fork" function initially, but found it involved unnecessary extra work. Since we didnâ€™t need that particular 
function for our repository management, we decided that cloning was a better and more efficient solution for 
our workflow.

We began working on the project and discussed how best to divide the work among us. We focused on finding a 
structure that makes it easier for everyone to contribute and keep the project organized.

Commits
Today, we made our first commits to GitHub, marking the start of our collaborative work on the project. 
It felt great to see our first changes uploaded and integrated into the repository.

Kitchen View
After speaking with Mikael and receiving feedback, we decided to separate Kitchen View into a standalone 
application and created a new index.js file for it. After finishing the split, we committed the following:

git add .
git commit -m "Separated Kitchen View into a standalone application and created index.js"
git push
git pull (so that everyone stayed in sync)
(2024-09-28 / Menu View)
Similarly, we created the Menu View as a standalone application. We created menu.js and then committed the changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Separated Menu View into a standalone application and created menu.js"
git push
git pull

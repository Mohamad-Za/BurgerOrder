Reflection 1
Part 1: Introduction/Initial Thoughts
Purpose and Objectives: Start by explaining the purpose of the work you were doing. What was the main task or goal you set out to accomplish? How did you initially approach the project?
For example: "At the beginning of the project, my main focus was to set up the database connection. I expected this to be straightforward but soon realized that there were many configuration settings that required deeper understanding."
Expectations: Discuss what you thought would be easy or difficult before you started.
Example: "I assumed that integrating the database with the web application would be seamless, but I anticipated some minor issues with Docker configuration."
Part 2: Development/Process
Steps Taken: This is where you explain the actual steps you took during the work. Break it down into specific actions. What did you do first, and why?
Example: "I began by setting up a PostgreSQL database and used the Sequelize ORM for database interaction. This required some research, as I hadn’t worked much with Sequelize before. After reading the official documentation, I created models to represent the orders in the kitchen."
Challenges Faced: Reflect on the challenges or obstacles you encountered. What didn’t go according to plan, and how did you handle it?
Example: "The main challenge was setting up the Docker container. At first, the container wouldn’t connect to the PostgreSQL database. After several failed attempts, I realized the issue was with the network configuration in Docker Compose, which required me to reconfigure the ports and dependencies."
Part 3: Conclusion/Outcome
Results: Summarize what you were able to achieve by the end of this stage of the project. Did you accomplish your initial goal? Did you have to adjust your plan?

Example: "By the end of this stage, I successfully established a working connection between the application and the database. However, I had to rethink parts of my original strategy, especially concerning container orchestration."
Reflection on Learning: Reflect on what you learned from this part of the project. How has it improved your knowledge or skills?

Example: "Through trial and error, I gained a much deeper understanding of Docker’s networking configuration, which will help in future projects."

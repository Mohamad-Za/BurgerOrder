Submission Assignment 2: Implementation and Documentation

For our second assignment, we have successfully developed two main components: the BurgerOrderer, which serves 
as the web interface where customers can order and customize burgers, and the KitchenView, which acts as the 
kitchen display where staff can see incoming orders. 

To ensure a smooth deployment and operation of our application, we created Docker containers for all app 
components, including BurgerOrderer, KitchenView, and the MenuStore database. We also documented and automated 
the process for building and running these containers, making it easier for others to replicate our setup.

Furthermore, we have been diligently updating our engineerâ€™s diaries to reflect on our learning experiences 
and the implementation of the project. To facilitate collaboration and make it easier for others to contribute, 
we have created a README file that provides clear instructions for downloading and running the project. 
This will help others understand the project's structure and how to get it up and running on their own systems.
